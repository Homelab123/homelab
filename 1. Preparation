NOTE: I only have access to my main PC to do this

1. Updated my PC with latest BIOS, drivers, Windows updates & software updates.
2. Enabled virtualization in my BIOS settings (SVM Mode enabled since AMD CPU).
3. Downloaded & installed latest Cisco Packet Tracer and VmWare Workstation Pro (free versions).
4. Will make a full list of softwares etc later, I will also get the images I need for the VMs as I go (linux/windows servers and workstations)


Planning my approach:

1. I will first list all the components of network administration so I can touch on all of them.
2. I will simulate a network on packet tracer that will cover all of these components.
3. I will build that simulated network into a homelab in VMWare, scaled to what is possible (by that I mean I won't create 20 workstations etc since just a few is enough to showcase the example).
